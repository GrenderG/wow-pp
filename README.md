# WoW++
WoW++ is a whole new World of Warcraft core, built from the ground up. It features The Burning Crusade, but other expansions or classic support might be added later on. There is still a lot to do.


# Get started
We have several "How to build" guides in our Wiki. Please check them out.

# Branches
Source code should be published in three rolling branches:

The **[release branch](https://github.com/Kyoril/wow-pp/tree/release)** is extensively tested and should provide you with the most stable and usable version of the core.

The **[promoted branch](https://github.com/Kyoril/wow-pp/tree/promoted)** is updated with builds from the master branch, when the changes made their should be tested. This branch is used on the test server at **[nagrand.eu](http://www.nagrand.eu)**.

The **[master branch](https://github.com/Kyoril/wow-pp/tree/master)** tracks **[live changes](https://github.com/Kyoril/wow-pp/commits/master)** from the developers. This branch isn't garanmtueed to be stable or even compilable at all. You should use this branch only if you want to help developing the core actively.

Other branches may appear, which will be created by developers for certain features or fixes and should be merged into the branches listed above.
