# wow-pp
WoW++ is a whole new World of Warcraft core system, built from the ground up. It will feature The Burning Crusade, but other expansions or classic support might be added later on in a different branch.

## Roadmap
There is still A LOT to do on WoW++. Below is a list of the most important things to do next:

* Grid system development (visibility of objects)
* Movement system (players and creatures)
* Be able to leave a world through the logout command and go back to the character list
* Items
* Spell system & Combat
* AI

Of course there is even more to do... like quests, vendors, gossip options, groups, professions etc. etc., but one step after another.
