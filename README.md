# wow-pp
WoW++ is a whole new World of Warcraft core system, built from the ground up. It will feature The Burning Crusade, but other expansions or classic support might be added later on in a different branch.

## Roadmap
There is still A LOT to do on WoW++. Below is a list of the most important things to do next:

- [x] Grid system development (visibility of objects)
- [ ] Navigation system for creatures
- [x] Be able to leave a world through the logout command and go back to the character list
- [ ] Items
- [ ] Spell system & Combat
- [ ] Quests
- [ ] Groups
- [ ] Guilds
- [ ] Professions
- [ ] Trade
- [ ] Mail
- [ ] Auction Houses
- [ ] Weather
- [ ] World Events (Darkmoon Faire etc.)

Of course there is even more to do, and this roadmap is pretty rough. Also, it isn't complete. But let's take one step after another, shall we?
